# Restaurant Page

This was `restaurant page`, the [*10th project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) within the Odin Project curriculum and the 3rd one in the JavaScript course. This was a project intended to make students get familiar with webpack and loading assets using it.
